						<h2>About Water to Wine Cellar</h2>

						<p>Water to Wine Cellar was born from a desire to offer more than just exceptional wine — we exist to tell stories through each bottle. Our founder, inspired by the miraculous transformation at Cana, envisioned a space where faith, elegance, and tradition intersect. Every label reflects a message, every sip is a reminder of purpose and presence.</p>

						<p>Rooted in Christian values, we believe in craftsmanship with integrity, hospitality as ministry, and community over competition. Our wines are carefully curated to honor sacred stories and spiritual celebrations, from communion tables to joyful gatherings among family and friends.</p>

						<p>We invite you to explore our cellar, get to know our journey, and experience the richness of a wine brand grounded in biblical meaning and modern excellence.</p>

						<h2>Meet the Founders</h2>
						<p style="margin-top: 1em;">
						<strong>Danielle and Jonathan Chen</strong> are the husband-and-wife duo behind Water to Wine Cellar. What began as a conversation during their engagement about blending faith and legacy soon turned into a vision: to create a wine company that nourishes both the body and the soul.
					</p>
					<p>
						Danielle, born and raised in Houston, Texas, grew up in a family that celebrated every holiday, communion, and milestone around the table. With a background in visual storytelling and ministry, she brings creativity and conviction to the mission. Jonathan, a second-generation Taiwanese-American, developed a love for winemaking while traveling through Napa Valley with his father. With a background in agricultural engineering and a quiet strength, he anchors the production side of the business.
					</p>
					<p>
						Together, they are raising three children and building a legacy rooted in purpose, prayer, and hospitality. Every label is designed with intention, every blend crafted with reverence. Their dream is that each bottle carries not just flavor, but a message — that miracles still happen, and there is beauty in the sacred and the shared.
